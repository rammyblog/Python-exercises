""""Name and Email Addresses
Write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary as key-value pairs.
The program should display a menu that lets the user look up a personâ€™s email address, add
a new name and email address, change an existing email address, and delete an existing
name and email address. The program should pickle the dictionary and save it to a file
when the user exits the program. Each time the program starts,
it should retrieve the dictionary from the file and unpickle it"""
